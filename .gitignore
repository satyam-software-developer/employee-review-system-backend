# Ignore the node_modules directory
node_modules/
# This line ensures that the `node_modules` directory is not tracked by Git. 
# `node_modules` contains the installed dependencies for the project, which can be reinstalled by running `npm install` or `yarn install`. 
# It's unnecessary to store these in version control as they can be regenerated from the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.
